A implementation of Mathematical functions into an I2c screen powered by an Arduino.
Thanks to Darthtux#0435 that helped me when I really needed.
You will need the next libraries if you have an I2c screen controlled by the controler SSD1306:

SPI.h bookstore.

Wire.h bookstore.

Adafruit_GFX.h bookstore.

Adafruit_SSD1306.h bookstore.

# gfx Bookstore
https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-gfx-graphics-library over this webpage, you can find all different commands and how to use them for the I2c screen.
